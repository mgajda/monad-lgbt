synopsis:  Monad transformers for combining local and global state with backtracking/backjumping/continuations.

description: >
      This is library providing a nice typeclass interface for monads
      with two different states: local and global.
      Local state is backtraced whenever intervening monad transformer backtracks.
      Global state is preserved across all backtracing.
